# Code for Symmetry Constraints Enhance Long-term Stability and Accuracy in Unsupervised Learning of Geophysical Fluid Flows

This pytorch code shows how to train a deep neural network model for solving PDEs. We combined 1D group equivariant convolutional layers with mixed scalar-vector input fields for the neural network. An unsupervised learning approach, physical constraint loss was employed during the training. Here, it shows an example for 1D Shallow Water Equations.
